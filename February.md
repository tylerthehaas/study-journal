## Matthew 5

### Beattitudes
in the sermon on the mount Christ mentions some attributes that are to be rewarded. A lot of them have to do with humility in one form or another. 

* poor in spirit -> humble
* mourn -> sad, those that are humbled by circumstance
* meek -> humble
* hunger and thirst after righteousness -> seeking knowledge shows humility
* merciful -> generous, kind comes from humility
  - The most merciful people I know often say they are merciful because they've been there before and someone else showed them mercy
 
### disciples === salt

when offering sacrifices the jews were commanded to salt the meat. The meat represented the savior and we are the salt. As the salt in the story we must be pure (uncontaminated) or the sacrifice of the meat (savior) is no good. But how do we become pure? Through the blood of the savior and by bringing a broken heart and contrite spirit.
